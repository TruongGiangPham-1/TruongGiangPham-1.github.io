## Introduction
Neural network does not separate computation and memory like modern computer. 
This paper introduces external memory matrix $$M \in R^{N x W}$$ that the Atten based neural network can 
interacts with using diffrientiable attentions read and writes.

## How it works

### Read head
Returns a read vector $$\sum_{i}{N} M[i, ]\cdot w^r[i] $$ with read weighting $$w^r$$.

How is the read weighting learned.

### Write head

Writes M[i, j] = M[i, j]
