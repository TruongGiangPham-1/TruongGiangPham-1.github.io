# Welcome to my website

This website showcases my work in CMPUT 412 - Experimental Mobile Robotics. Here you'll find detailed reports and documentation of various robotics experiments and projects I've completed throughout the course.

## Project Overview

In this course, I've worked with:
- **DuckieBot** - A differential drive robot platform
- **ROS (Robot Operating System)** - For robot software development
- **Computer Vision** - For perception and navigation
- **Kinematics and Control** - For robot motion planning

## Available Reports

- [**Lab 1 - Duckiebot Setup**]({{ '/412-projects/A1' | relative_url }})  
  Initial setup and configuration of the DuckieBot platform

- [**Lab 2 - ROS Development and Kinematics**]({{ '/412-projects/A2' | relative_url }})  
  Working with ROS basics and implementing robot kinematics

- [**Lab 3 - Advanced Topics**]({{ '/412-projects/A3' | relative_url }})  
  More advanced robotics concepts and implementations

- [**Graduate Project**]({{ '/412-projects/grad' | relative_url }})  
  Advanced research project for graduate students
