It was hard to make the duckiebot run in a straight line. As you see in the video, the duckiebotis not stable. We find that it is hard to replicate the straight line behavior on a subsequent run. Perhaps it because of the terraine RNG. 

# Kinematic

I followed the wheel calibration tutorial [here](https://docs.duckietown.com/daffy/opmanual-duckiebot/operations/calibration_wheels/index.html) to calibrate the trim value. 
Trim value is used to control the amount of horizontal drift of the duckie bot. 
Trim should be 0 if wheels and motors are balanced, but our is not
We tried the trim value between 0 to -0.8 and and the TA Dikshant helped us fine tune to -0.063. Negative trim to make the duckiebot drift more to the right. 

We had a straighter 2 meters run with trim value -0.8 but we forgot to record it, but we could not replicate it on the subsequent run.

Between many runs, robot veered right at different rates despite having the same trim value. We think the reason is that the wheels are sensitive to the small bumps in the terrain. Sometime it makes a sharp drift or a slow drift. 
Perhaps that's replicating the good run was difficult despite having the trim value.

Increasing speed helped overcome some of the bumps.

# Intrinsic Camera calibration

I learn that intrinsic coordinates contain pixel scaling, focal length, skew, principle point coordinates, and radial distortion. In order project accurate world POV to 2D image plane of the robot, we need to calibrate these parameters.

# Extrinsic Camera calibration

Extrinsic calibration parameters include rotation and translation relative to the world frame. ([cite](https://github.com/duckietown/lectures/blob/master/1_ideal/25_computer_vision/cv_calibration.pdf)

Overall Camera calibrations were quite easy. The GUI interface was responsive. We remembered to only hit commit and not save.
